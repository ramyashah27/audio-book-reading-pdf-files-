a new paragraph. The 
 
<br>tag forces a line break wherever you place it
. It is similar to single spacing 
in a document.

<p>This <br> is a Para<br> 
graph with 
 
line breaks</p>

and specifying the name of th
e color you want.

HTML Lists
 
HTML provides a simple way to show unordered lists (bullet lists) or ordered 
lists (numbered lists). 
 
Unordered Lists
 
An unordered list is a list of items marked with bullets(typically small black 
circles). A
n unordered list starts with the <ul>tag. Each list item starts with the 
<li>tag. 
 
This Code  <ul> 
 
<li>Coffee</li> 
 
<li>Milk</li> 
 
</ul>
 

 
…
  
Coffee 
 

 
…
  
Milk
 
 
Ordered Lists
 
An ordered list is also a list of items. The list items are marked with numbers. 
An ordered list starts 
 
with the <ol>tag. Each list item starts with the <li>tag. 
 
This Code   Would Display 
 
<ol> 
 
<li>Coffee</li> 
 
<li>Milk</li> 
 
</ol>
 
1.  Coffee 
 
2.  Milk
 
Inside a list item you can put paragraphs, line breaks, images, links, other lists, 
etc.
